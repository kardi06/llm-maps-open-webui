# Create a new story (2025-07-27 09:53Z)

_**User**_

*create-story

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has activated the "sm" mode and is requesting the "*create-story" command. Looking at the mode rules, I need to follow the activation instructions and adopt the persona defined.

From the yaml configuration:
- I am "Bob" - a Technical Scrum Master - Story Preparation Specialist
- My role is story creation expert who prepares detailed, actionable stories for AI developers
- Commands available include "draft" which executes "create-next-story.md" task
- The user typed "*create-story" which seems to map to the "draft" command

However, I notice the user typed "*create-story" but the available command is "*draft" which executes the create-next-story.md task. I should clarify this or treat it as equivalent since the intent seems clear.

Looking at the rules:
- I need to load dependency files only when user requests specific command execution
- The command "*draft" executes task "create-next-story.md"
- I should match user requests flexibly (the example shows "draft story" mapping to create-next-story task)

Since the user is asking for "*create-story" and I have a "*draft" command that executes "create-next-story.md", this seems like a clear match. I should load the create-next-story.md task file and execute it.

First, let me adopt the persona as instructed and then load the task file.</details></think>

üèÉ **Bob here - Technical Scrum Master & Story Preparation Specialist!**

I see you want to create a story! The command you're looking for is `*draft` which executes our create-next-story procedure. Let me load that task for you.

---

Read file: .bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have the create-next-story task loaded. This is a comprehensive workflow for creating the next story. I need to follow this step by step, starting with Step 0 - loading the core configuration.

Let me execute this task according to the instructions. The task is very detailed and I need to follow it sequentially.

First step is to load the core-config.yaml file.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Now I'll execute the **Create Next Story** task following the detailed workflow. Let me start with Step 0 - loading the core configuration.

---

Read file: .bmad-core/core-config.yaml

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I have the core configuration loaded. Key configurations I've extracted:
- `devStoryLocation`: docs/stories
- `prd.*`: 
  - prdFile: docs/prd.md
  - prdVersion: v4
  - prdSharded: true
  - prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
  - epicFilePattern: epic-{n}*.md
- `architecture.*`:
  - architectureFile: docs/architecture.md
  - architectureVersion: v4
  - architectureSharded: true
  - architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture

Since architectureVersion is v4 and architectureSharded is true, I'll need to follow the structured reading approach.

Now I need to proceed to Step 1 - identify the next story for preparation. I need to:
1. Locate epic files based on the prdSharded configuration
2. Check if devStoryLocation has story files and find the highest one
3. Determine what the next story should be

Let me start by checking the epic files and existing stories.</details></think>

---

Excellent! Core configuration loaded successfully. I can see we have:
- **Stories Location**: `docs/stories`
- **Epic Files**: Located in `docs/prd` with pattern `epic-{n}*.md`
- **Architecture**: Version v4, sharded in `docs/architecture`

Now proceeding to **Step 1: Identify Next Story for Preparation**

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see that:
1. In the PRD directory, there are two files: `index.md` and `project-llm-google-maps-agent-for-openwebui.md`
2. The `docs/stories` directory doesn't exist yet, which means there are no existing story files

According to the task instructions: "If no story files exist: The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)"

I need to look for epic files matching the pattern `epic-{n}*.md`. The file `project-llm-google-maps-agent-for-openwebui.md` might be an epic file, but it doesn't match the expected pattern. Let me examine these files to understand the structure better.</details></think>

I can see that:
- Epic files are in `docs/prd`
- The `docs/stories` directory doesn't exist yet (no existing story files)

According to the task rules: **"If no story files exist: The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)"**

I notice there are no epic files matching the expected pattern `epic-{n}*.md`. Let me check the main PRD file to see if it contains epic information:

---

Read file: docs/prd/project-llm-google-maps-agent-for-openwebui.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>This is a well-structured PRD but it's not organized into separate epic files as expected by the BMad workflow. This PRD describes the full project scope but doesn't break it down into epics with individual stories.

According to the task instructions, when no epic files matching the pattern exist, I should work with what I have. Since the PRD contains the project requirements and I need to create story 1.1, I should:

1. Treat this as Epic 1 (the first and possibly only epic for this project)
2. Create the first story (1.1) based on the milestones and features described
3. Proceed with gathering architecture context

Looking at the PRD, I can see several logical stories that could be extracted from the milestones:
- FastAPI backend agent development
- OpenWebUI backend configuration  
- Frontend/Svelte map rendering
- End-to-end integration
- Security and monitoring

For story 1.1, I should pick the foundational piece which appears to be the FastAPI backend agent.

Let me announce this and then proceed with gathering architecture context.</details></think>

---

**üìã ANALYSIS COMPLETE:**

**Epic Structure Found**: The PRD is organized as a single comprehensive document rather than separate epic files. This contains all project requirements for the "LLM Google Maps Agent for OpenWebUI" project.

**Next Story Identified**: Since no story files exist, the next story is **1.1** (first story of first epic).

**üéØ Identified next story for preparation: 1.1 - Backend API Foundation**

Based on the PRD milestones, Story 1.1 will focus on building the foundational FastAPI backend agent with Google Maps integration endpoints.

Now proceeding to **Step 2: Gather Architecture Context** to build the complete technical context for this story.

Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to create the story. Let me organize what I've gathered:

**Story 1.1**: Backend API Foundation (based on the PRD milestone for FastAPI backend agent)

**Architecture Context Gathered:**
- **System Overview**: FastAPI service with `/find_places`, `/get_directions`, `/place_details` endpoints [Source: docs/architect/2-system-overview.md]
- **API Contracts**: Exact endpoint specifications with params and returns [Source: docs/architect/4-agent-api-contracts.md]
- **Security Requirements**: Google API key security, input validation, rate limiting [Source: docs/architect/5-security-reliability.md]
- **Data Flow**: Backend ‚Üí FastAPI agent workflow [Source: docs/architect/3-data-api-flow.md]
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI already included in backend/requirements.txt

Now I need to create the story file following the template format. Based on the PRD and architecture, Story 1.1 should focus on creating the foundational FastAPI backend agent.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to create the next story. Based on the process I just completed, I created Story 1.1 (Backend API Foundation). Now they want the next story, which would be Story 1.2.

Let me follow the same create-next-story task workflow. I need to:

1. Load core configuration ‚úì (already done)
2. Identify next story - Since 1.1 was created but not marked as "Done", I need to check if this is an override situation or if we should proceed to 1.2
3. Gather story requirements from epic
4. Gather architecture context
5. Create the story

Let me check the current status of story 1.1 first, then proceed with creating 1.2.</details></think>

üèÉ **Bob here!** Let me identify the next story to create following our **Create Next Story** procedure.

Read file: docs/stories/1.1.backend-api-foundation.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see that Story 1.1 has status "Draft", not "Done". According to the task instructions:

"If highest story exists:
- Verify status is 'Done'. If not, alert user: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"

So I need to alert the user about this and ask if they want to override.</details></think>

**‚ö†Ô∏è ALERT: Found incomplete story!**

**File**: `1.1.backend-api-foundation.md`
**Status**: Draft

You should fix this story first (move it to "Done" status), but would you like to **accept risk & override** to create the next story in draft?

**Options:**
1. **Proceed with Story 1.2** (override risk - you'll have two draft stories)
2. **Stop and complete Story 1.1 first** (recommended workflow)
3. **Cancel story creation**

What would you like to do?
