# Create a new story (2025-07-27 09:47Z)

*create-story

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user activated the "sm" mode which makes me a Scrum Master agent named Bob. Looking at the rules, I need to:

1. I've already been activated as the "sm" agent with the persona of a Technical Scrum Master - Story Preparation Specialist
2. The user said "*create-story" which seems to be a command, but looking at my commands list, I have:
   - help: Show numbered list of commands
   - draft: Execute task create-next-story.md
   - correct-course: Execute task correct-course.md
   - story-checklist: Execute task execute-checklist.md with checklist story-draft-checklist.md
   - exit: Say goodbye and abandon persona

The user said "*create-story" but my command is "*draft" which executes the "create-next-story.md" task. This seems like they want to create a story, so "*draft" is the closest match.

According to my rules:
- I need to execute task create-next-story.md 
- Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
- So create-next-story.md would be at .bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md
- I should load this file when the user requests specific command execution

Let me load the create-next-story.md task file and execute it.</details></think>

üèÉ **Bob - Technical Scrum Master** here! 

I understand you want to create a story. Let me execute the `*draft` command which runs our story creation process.

---

Read file: .bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to execute this task step by step. Let me start with step 0 - loading the core configuration file.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I'm now executing the **create-next-story** task. Let me work through this systematically:

## üéØ **Step 0: Loading Core Configuration**

---

Read file: .bmad-core/core-config.yaml

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I have the core configuration. Now I need to proceed to step 1 - identify the next story for preparation. Let me check what stories already exist in the devStoryLocation.</details></think>

---

Excellent! Core configuration loaded successfully. Here are the key settings:
- **Story Location**: `docs/stories`
- **PRD**: Sharded in `docs/prd` (v4)
- **Architecture**: Sharded in `docs/architecture` (v4)

## üîç **Step 1: Identifying Next Story for Preparation**

---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file 'd:\captain garuda\project\llm-maps-open-webui\docs\stories'

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The stories directory doesn't exist yet, which means no story files exist. According to the task instructions: "If no story files exist: The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)"

So I should announce that the next story is 1.1. Now I need to locate the epic files to get the story requirements.</details></think>

---

The `docs/stories` directory doesn't exist yet, which means **no story files exist**. 

**üéØ Identified next story for preparation: 1.1 - First story of Epic 1**

## üìã **Step 2: Gathering Epic Requirements**

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory docs/prd ‚Ä¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÑ `index.md` |
| üìÑ `project-llm-google-maps-agent-for-openwebui.md` |

</details>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the PRD directory has index.md and a project file. Let me look for epic files based on the pattern "epic-{n}*.md". I don't see any epic files yet, so let me check the index.md and the main project file to understand the epic structure.</details></think>

---

Read file: docs/prd/index.md

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "epic-1" ‚Ä¢ **2** results</summary>

| `d:\captain garuda\project\llm-maps-open-webui\backend\open_webui\static\web-app-manifest-512x512.png` |

</details>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The file search didn't find epic-1 files, and the index just has a table of contents. Let me read the main project PRD file to see if it contains the epic information.</details></think>

---

Read file: docs/prd/project-llm-google-maps-agent-for-openwebui.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see that this PRD doesn't have explicit epic breakdown yet - it's more of a high-level project description. I don't see any epic-{n}.md files in the directory. According to the task, I need epics to identify story requirements. 

Let me check if there might be epic files in a different location or if I need to look at the architecture documents to understand how to proceed. Let me also check the architecture structure since the task requires me to gather architecture context regardless.</details></think>

---

I notice that the PRD doesn't have explicit epics broken down yet - it contains the overall project vision and milestones. Let me check if there are epic files elsewhere, or if we need to work with the high-level milestones as our epic guidance.

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "epic-1" ‚Ä¢ **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file 'd:\captain garuda\project\llm-maps-open-webui\docs\architecture'

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>It looks like both the epic files and the architecture directory don't exist yet. This suggests the project is in early setup phase. Since I'm a Scrum Master whose job is to create stories from existing PRD and architecture, but these structured documents don't exist yet, I should inform the user of this situation.

According to my role and the task instructions, I need these documents to properly create a story. The PRD has high-level information but no epic breakdown, and there's no architecture documentation yet.

Let me check what the high-level docs that do exist contain to see if we can work with what we have.</details></think>

---

I'm encountering a situation where the project structure isn't fully set up yet:

‚ùå **Missing Epic Structure**: No `epic-1*.md` files found in `docs/prd/`
‚ùå **Missing Architecture Documentation**: `docs/architecture/` directory doesn't exist

The current PRD contains high-level project information but hasn't been broken down into specific epics and stories yet.

**üö® SCRUM MASTER GUIDANCE NEEDED**

As your Scrum Master, I need clarification on how to proceed:

**Option 1**: Create the first epic structure based on the existing PRD milestones and then create Story 1.1
**Option 2**: Stop here and recommend setting up proper epic breakdown first  
**Option 3**: Work with what we have and create a basic story from the high-level requirements

The PRD contains these key milestones that could become epics:
1. FastAPI backend agent with endpoints
2. OpenWebUI backend configuration for tools
3. Svelte frontend for map rendering
4. End-to-end integration testing
5. Security, logging, and quota controls

**What would you like me to do?**
1. **Create Epic 1** from the first milestone and proceed with Story 1.1
2. **Recommend epic structure setup** first before story creation
3. **Different approach** - please specify

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed! üèÉ
