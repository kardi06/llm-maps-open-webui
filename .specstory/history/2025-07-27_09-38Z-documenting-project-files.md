_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to run the `*shard-doc` command twice:
1. `*shard-doc docs/prd.md docs/prd` - shard the PRD document to a destination directory called `docs/prd`
2. `*shard-doc docs/architec.md` - shard the architecture document (note they typo'd "architec" instead of "architect")

Looking at the mode-specific rule, I'm operating as "Sarah" the Product Owner agent. The commands show that `shard-doc` is available and takes a document and destination parameter.

From the activation instructions:
- I need to be in the Sarah/Product Owner persona
- When executing tasks from dependencies, I need to follow task instructions exactly as written
- The `shard-doc` command runs "the task shard-doc against the optionally provided document to the specified destination"

I need to:
1. Load the shard-doc task from dependencies (.bmad-core/tasks/shard-doc.md)
2. Execute it for both documents

First, let me check what files exist and understand the typo in the second command.</details></think>

Hello! I'm Sarah, your Technical Product Owner. I'll help you shard those documents using the shard-doc task.

Let me first check the available documents and then execute the shard-doc task for both:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I found the architecture document is actually named `architect.md` (not "architec.md" as the user typed). Now I have the shard-doc task instructions. 

According to the task, I need to first check if markdownExploder is set to true in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml and try to use the md-tree command if available.

Let me check the config first, then proceed with the sharding.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I found the architecture document is `docs/architect.md`. Now let me check the configuration and execute the shard-doc task for both documents.

---

Read file: .bmad-core/core-config.yaml

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The markdownExploder is set to true, so I should try to use the md-tree command first. Let me try running the explode command for both documents:

1. `md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd`
2. `md-tree explode docs/architect.md docs/architect` (correcting the filename)

I'll run these commands and see if they work. If they fail because md-tree isn't installed, I'll inform the user and stop as instructed.</details></think>

---

Excellent! The markdownExploder setting is enabled. I'll now attempt to use the md-tree command to shard both documents automatically:

---

```bash
md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd
```

```
PS D:\captain garuda\project\llm-maps-open-webui> md-tree explode docs/prd.md do
cs/prd

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Both shard-doc operations completed successfully using the automated md-tree tool. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

1. PRD document: Successfully sharded from `docs/prd.md` to `docs/prd/` with 2 files created
2. Architecture document: Successfully sharded from `docs/architect.md` to `docs/architect/` with 8 files created

The automated tool handled everything properly, including creating index files and maintaining proper structure. I should report this success to the user.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I have enough context to create a brownfield epic. Based on my analysis:

**Existing Project Context:**
- This is Open WebUI - a self-hosted AI platform with Svelte frontend and Python FastAPI backend
- Has existing tools integration via tools.py router
- Supports function calling with LLMs (Ollama/OpenAI)
- Has pattern for adding new API endpoints and tools
- Architecture already supports tool registration and invocation

**Enhancement Scope:**
This appears to be a new feature addition rather than modification, but since it's integrating into existing OpenWebUI patterns and infrastructure, it fits the brownfield criteria. The enhancement is well-scoped and can be broken into focused stories.

Now I'll create the epic following the required structure.</details></think>

---

Now I have sufficient context about the project. Let me create a focused brownfield epic based on my analysis:

## 📋 **Project Analysis - COMPLETED**

**Existing Project Context:**
- ✅ Project purpose and current functionality understood: Open WebUI is a self-hosted AI platform with chat interface
- ✅ Existing technology stack identified: Svelte frontend, Python FastAPI backend, LLM integration (Ollama/OpenAI)
- ✅ Current architecture patterns noted: Tool/function calling via routers, existing tools.py pattern
- ✅ Integration points identified: Backend routers, frontend chat components, LLM tool registration

**Enhancement Scope:**
- ✅ Enhancement clearly defined: Add Google Maps integration for place search and directions
- ✅ Impact assessed: Extends existing tool system without breaking current functionality
- ✅ Integration points identified: Tools router, chat UI, LLM function calling
- ✅ Success criteria established: Natural language maps queries with inline results

---

## 🎯 **EPIC CREATION**

**Epic Title:** Google Maps Agent Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

**Epic Goal:** Enable users to find places and get directions through natural language chat by integrating Google Maps APIs into OpenWebUI's existing tool system, maintaining security and following established patterns.

**Epic Description:**

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: OpenWebUI chat interface with LLM tool/function calling support
- Technology stack: Svelte frontend, Python FastAPI backend, existing tools router pattern
- Integration points: `/backend/open_webui/routers/tools.py`, chat UI components, LLM function registration system

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added: Google Maps agent service with place search and directions functionality
- How it integrates: New FastAPI microservice + OpenWebUI tool registration following existing tools.py patterns
- Success criteria: Users can ask "find sushi near me" and see map results inline in chat

**Stories:**

1. **Story 1:** Create Google Maps FastAPI Agent Service
   - Build standalone FastAPI service with `/find_places`, `/get_directions`, `/place_details` endpoints
   - Implement Google Maps API integration with rate limiting and security
   - Add configuration management for API keys and quotas

2. **Story 2:** Integrate Maps Agent with OpenWebUI Backend  
   - Register maps functions in OpenWebUI tools system
   - Create tool wrappers that call the Maps Agent service
   - Implement proper error handling and response formatting

3. **Story 3:** Add Frontend Map Display Components
   - Create Svelte components for rendering map results in chat
   - Implement "Open in Google Maps" functionality
   - Style components to match existing OpenWebUI design patterns

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (none required)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (extends chat display components)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (external service call pattern)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Primary Risk:** Google Maps API quota exhaustion or service disruption
- **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, quota monitoring, and graceful fallbacks in agent service
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable tool registration to remove maps functionality without affecting core OpenWebUI

**Definition of Done:**
- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing functionality verified through testing
- ✅ Integration points working correctly
- ✅ Documentation updated appropriately
- ✅ No regression in existing features

---

## ✅ **SCOPE VALIDATION - COMPLETED**

**Scope Validation:**
- ✅ Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- ✅ No architectural documentation required (follows existing patterns)
- ✅ Enhancement follows existing tools integration patterns
- ✅ Integration complexity is manageable (standard API service pattern)

**Risk Assessment:**
- ✅ Risk to existing system is low (additive functionality)
- ✅ Rollback plan is feasible (disable tool registration)
- ✅ Testing approach covers existing functionality
- ✅ Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (standard FastAPI/tools pattern)

**Completeness Check:**
- ✅ Epic goal is clear and achievable
- ✅ Stories are properly scoped
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable
- ✅ Dependencies are identified

---

## 🤝 **STORY MANAGER HANDOFF**

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running **Svelte + Python FastAPI + LLM integration**
- Integration points: **`/backend/open_webui/routers/tools.py` for tool registration, chat UI components for display, existing function calling patterns**
- Existing patterns to follow: **FastAPI router patterns, tool registration in tools.py, Svelte component architecture**
- Critical compatibility requirements: **Follow existing tools.py registration patterns, maintain OpenWebUI chat UI consistency, implement proper API key security**
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering **natural language Google Maps integration for place search and directions in OpenWebUI chat interface**."

---

## 🎉 **Epic Creation Successful!**

The Google Maps Agent Integration epic has been created successfully with:
- ✅ Clearly defined scope (3 focused stories)
- ✅ Proper integration approach respecting existing architecture
- ✅ Minimal risk to existing functionality  
- ✅ Logical story sequence for safe implementation
- ✅ Clear compatibility requirements
- ✅ Feasible rollback plan

This epic is ready for Story Manager development and maintains the integrity of the existing OpenWebUI system while adding valuable maps functionality! 🗺️

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to create another epic. Since they just ran the create-epic task and I completed it for the Google Maps Agent Integration, they might want me to create a different epic. Let me check if there are any other epics needed based on the PRD or if they want me to create a new epic for a different enhancement.

Let me first check if there are any other features or requirements mentioned in the PRD that could warrant separate epics, or if they want me to create a completely new epic for a different functionality.

I should ask for clarification about what specific epic they want me to create, since I just completed the Google Maps integration epic.</details></think>

---

I just completed creating the Google Maps Agent Integration epic. Would you like me to create another epic for a different enhancement or feature? 

To help me create the most appropriate epic, could you please specify:

1. **What specific enhancement or feature** should this new epic focus on?
2. **Is this related to the existing Google Maps project** or a completely different functionality?

Some potential epic candidates I could help with based on the project context:

🗺️ **Maps-Related Extensions:**
- Advanced Maps Features (traffic, street view, business hours)
- Maps Analytics & Usage Monitoring
- Multi-provider Maps Support (OpenStreetMap, Bing Maps)

🔧 **OpenWebUI Enhancements:**
- Enhanced Tool Management UI
- Advanced Chat Export/Import
- Custom Agent Personalities

🔐 **Security & Performance:**
- API Key Management Dashboard
- Rate Limiting & Quota Management
- Caching Layer Implementation

Or if you have a specific feature or enhancement in mind that's not listed above, please let me know and I'll create a focused brownfield epic for it following the same process I used for the Google Maps integration.

What would you like the new epic to focus on?

_**User**_

*create-epic

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to create another epic using the *create-epic command. Since they didn't specify what the epic should be about, I need to follow the brownfield-create-epic task instructions. Looking at the task, I should analyze the project and create an epic, but I need to understand what enhancement they want to focus on.

However, looking at the instructions more carefully, the task assumes that the user has a specific enhancement in mind when they call *create-epic. The task says "Before creating the epic, gather essential information about the existing project" and then talks about "Enhancement Scope" - which implies there's already a defined enhancement.

Since the user hasn't specified what enhancement they want an epic for, I should ask them for clarification about what specific enhancement or feature they want the epic to address. This is the most helpful approach rather than just creating a random epic.</details></think>

---

I'll help you create another epic! However, to create the most valuable and focused epic, I need to understand what specific enhancement or feature you'd like this epic to address.

**Please specify the enhancement you want the epic to focus on:**

For example:
- "Advanced chat export functionality" 
- "User role management improvements"
- "API monitoring dashboard"
- "Multi-language support"
- "Custom themes and branding"
- Or any other specific feature/enhancement you have in mind

The brownfield-create-epic task is designed for **small, focused enhancements** that can be completed in 1-3 stories without major architectural changes. Once you tell me the specific enhancement, I'll:

1. ✅ Analyze how it fits with the existing OpenWebUI system
2. ✅ Create a focused epic with clear scope and integration approach  
3. ✅ Define 1-3 stories that safely implement the enhancement
4. ✅ Ensure compatibility with existing functionality
5. ✅ Provide clear handoff instructions for story development

**What specific enhancement would you like me to create an epic for?**
