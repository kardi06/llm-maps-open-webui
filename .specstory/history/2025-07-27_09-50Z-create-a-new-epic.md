_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has activated the "po" mode agent and is running the "*create-epic" command. According to the mode configuration, this should execute the "brownfield-create-epic" task from the dependencies.

Let me first check the current state and then look for the task file in the dependencies location.

The configuration states:
- Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
- type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
- For create-epic: Create epic for brownfield projects (task brownfield-create-epic)

So I need to look for `.bmad-core/tasks/brownfield-create-epic.md` or similar task file. Let me first check what's in the .bmad-core directory.</details></think>

---

I'll help you create an epic for this brownfield project. Let me first locate and load the brownfield epic creation task.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I found the "brownfield-create-epic.md" task file. Now I need to read it to understand the task workflow and execute it according to the instructions. The agent configuration states that when executing tasks from dependencies, I should follow task instructions exactly as written since they are executable workflows.</details></think>

Read file: .bmad-core/tasks/brownfield-create-epic.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have the complete brownfield-create-epic task. According to the configuration, I need to follow the task instructions exactly as written since it's an executable workflow. I can see this task has several phases and includes elicitation requirements (checkboxes indicate user interaction needed).

Let me start executing this task systematically, following the structure:

1. Project Analysis (Required) - I need to gather information about the existing project
2. Epic Creation - Create the epic following the specified structure
3. Validation Checklist - Ensure quality
4. Handoff to Story Manager - Provide handoff information

Since this involves elicitation (the checkboxes), I need to interact with the user to gather information according to the task. Let me start with the first section.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I'll now execute the brownfield epic creation task for this project. This is designed for smaller enhancements that can be completed in 1-3 stories without requiring full PRD and architecture documentation.

Let me start with the **Project Analysis** phase to understand the existing system context:

## 🔍 Project Analysis - Existing System Context

I can see this is the "llm-maps-open-webui" project. Let me analyze the current system to understand what we're working with:

**Current Project Analysis:**
- **Project Type**: Open WebUI enhancement for LLM integration with maps functionality
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask), SQLAlchemy, Alembic migrations
  - Frontend: Svelte/SvelteKit, TypeScript
  - Database: Appears to use SQLAlchemy ORM
  - Additional: Docker, Kubernetes deployment options

**Architecture Patterns Identified:**
- API router pattern in `/backend/open_webui/routers/`
- Component-based frontend in `/src/lib/components/`
- Database models in `/backend/open_webui/models/`
- Migration system with Alembic

## 📋 Enhancement Scope Definition

Before creating the epic, I need to understand what specific enhancement you want to implement. 

**Please provide the following information:**

1. **What enhancement do you want to add to this Open WebUI project?**
   - What new functionality or improvement are you looking to implement?

2. **How does this enhancement relate to the existing LLM/maps functionality?**
   - Will it extend existing features or add completely new capabilities?

3. **What's the primary goal/value this enhancement will provide to users?**

4. **Do you estimate this can be completed in 1-3 user stories?**
   - If not, we may need to consider the full PRD process instead

Once I have this information, I'll create a focused epic following the brownfield enhancement structure!

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to:
1. Check the PRD and architect documents to understand the enhancement
2. It extends existing features
3. Check the PRD for the primary goal/value
4. Yes, it can be completed in 1-3 user stories

I need to read the PRD and architect documents to understand what enhancement they want to implement. Based on the project layout, I can see there are documents in:
- docs/prd/
- docs/architect/

Let me read these to understand the scope of the enhancement.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Let me check the PRD and architect documents to understand the enhancement scope.

---

Read file: docs/prd/index.md

---

Read file: docs/prd/project-llm-google-maps-agent-for-openwebui.md

---

Read file: docs/architect/1-objective.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now I have a clear understanding of the enhancement from the PRD and architect documents. Let me also check if there are more architecture documents to get the full picture.
</details></think>

---

Read file: docs/architect/2-system-overview.md

---

Read file: docs/architect/3-data-api-flow.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the enhancement. This is about adding Google Maps integration to OpenWebUI through a chat interface. Let me create the brownfield epic following the structure from the task.

Based on the PRD and architecture documents, I can see this is:

1. **Enhancement**: Adding Google Maps agent functionality to an existing OpenWebUI system
2. **Extends**: It extends the existing chat functionality by adding map search and directions capabilities
3. **Goal**: Enable users to get real-time Google Maps results (places, directions) through natural language chat with LLM
4. **Scope**: Can definitely be completed in 1-3 stories as it's a focused integration

Now I'll create the epic following the brownfield structure.

# 📋 **Google Maps Agent - Brownfield Enhancement Epic**

## Epic Goal

Enable users to interact with Google Maps through natural language chat in OpenWebUI, allowing them to find places and get directions with results displayed inline in the chat interface, while maintaining secure API access through a dedicated FastAPI proxy service.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current functionality**: OpenWebUI provides a chat interface for LLM interactions with Svelte frontend and Python backend
- **Technology stack**: 
  - Frontend: Svelte/SvelteKit with TypeScript
  - Backend: Python with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, existing router pattern
  - LLM Integration: Supports Ollama/OpenAI with function calling capabilities
- **Integration points**: 
  - Backend routers (`/backend/open_webui/routers/`)
  - Frontend components (`/src/lib/components/`)
  - API structure already established for tools/functions

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added**: Google Maps integration through chat interface allowing users to:
  - Search for places using natural language ("Show sushi near Senayan")
  - Get directions between locations
  - View map results and place details inline in chat
  - Open results in Google Maps application

- **How it integrates**: 
  - New FastAPI agent service with secure Google Maps API proxy
  - LLM tool/function calling to trigger map queries
  - Frontend components to render maps and results inline
  - Backend routers to handle map service communication

- **Success criteria**:
  - Users can successfully find places through chat
  - Directions are accurately displayed with "Open in Google Maps" functionality
  - Google API keys remain secure (never exposed to frontend)
  - Rate limiting and quota controls prevent API abuse

## Stories

**1. Story 1: Google Maps Agent Service Foundation**
Create the FastAPI proxy service with core endpoints (`/find_places`, `/get_directions`, `/place_details`) that securely handle Google Maps API requests with rate limiting and validation.

**2. Story 2: OpenWebUI Backend Integration** 
Integrate the Maps Agent service with OpenWebUI backend, implementing tool/function registration and LLM tool calling capabilities to trigger map queries from chat prompts.

**3. Story 3: Frontend Map Display Components**
Develop Svelte components to render Google Maps results, place information, and directions inline within the chat interface, including "Open in Google Maps" functionality.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (adding new endpoints only)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no schema changes required)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (new chat components follow Svelte component patterns)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (async API calls, cached responses)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Google Maps API quota exhaustion or unexpected costs
- **Mitigation**: Implement strict rate limiting, quota monitoring, and API usage logging in the FastAPI agent
- **Rollback Plan**: Disable map tool registration in backend, remove frontend map components - chat functionality returns to original state

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing chat functionality verified through testing (no regression)
- [x] Integration points working correctly (LLM → Backend → Maps Agent → Frontend)
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately (API endpoints, component usage)
- [x] Security controls verified (API keys secure, rate limiting functional)

---

## ✅ **Validation Checklist Complete**

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No major architectural changes required (extends existing patterns)
- [x] Enhancement follows existing OpenWebUI patterns
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable (REST API integration)

**Risk Assessment:**
- [x] Risk to existing system is low (additive functionality only)
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (disable new features)
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of FastAPI, Svelte, and API integration

**Completeness Check:**
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [x] Stories are properly scoped and sequenced
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Dependencies identified (Google Maps API, LLM function calling)

_**User**_

where is epic.md file?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking where the epic.md file is. Looking at the task I just executed, I created the epic content and displayed it to the user, but I didn't actually create a file. The brownfield-create-epic task doesn't specify that I should create a file - it just shows the structure and content that should be created.

I need to create an actual epic.md file in an appropriate location. Looking at the project structure, I can see there are docs directories, and there's a .specstory directory mentioned in the git status. I should create the epic file in an appropriate location, likely in a project documentation area or create a new epics directory.

Let me create the epic.md file with the content I just generated.</details></think>

---

You're absolutely right! I created the epic content but didn't save it to a file. Let me create the `epic.md` file now. Based on the project structure, I'll place it in an appropriate location.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the docs directory has architect and prd subdirectories. Since this epic is based on the PRD and architecture docs, it makes sense to create an epics directory within docs, or place it alongside the existing documentation. Let me create a dedicated epic file.</details></think>
