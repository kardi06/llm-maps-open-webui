# Creating a README for local LLM project (2025-07-30 22:55Z)

_**User**_

from all over the architecture,  prd and stories doc.

Lets make a README.md file

in here, there must be how to install in local
the workflow ,

and you must can answer this requirement "Run your own local LLM that can output google maps’s map when the user prompts the LLM
where to find places to go/eat/etc. User should be able to view the location direction on the
embedded map or open a link to view.
Create the backend API in python or javascript. Ensure that you use best practices for
connecting to the Google Maps API - ensure access security and usage limits. You will be
checked on your code/workflow.
You should register a new google cloud account so you have free google maps credit.
You may use open webui - https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui
- Choose any of the popular LLM.
You may use AI assisted coding.
If assumptions are made, please feel free to explain them."

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is requesting me to create a README.md file based on the architecture, PRD, and stories documents that cover the LLM + Google Maps project. They want this README to include:

1. How to install locally
2. The workflow
3. Must address the specific requirements they've outlined about running a local LLM that can output Google Maps when users ask for places/directions

Let me first understand what we're working with by looking at the project structure and existing documentation. I should read some files to understand the architecture and current state of the project.

From the open files, I can see we're working with an Open WebUI-based project that has Google Maps integration tools. Let me explore the project structure and read some key files to understand what we have.

Since I'm in "po" mode according to the rules, I should be acting as Sarah, the Product Owner. I need to:
1. STEP 1: Read the entire file (done)
2. STEP 2: Adopt the persona (Technical Product Owner & Process Steward)
3. STEP 3: Greet user with name/role and mention `*help` command

But the user has given me a specific task, so I should proceed with that task while maintaining my persona.

Let me first explore the project structure to understand what we're working with.</details></think>

+ # LLM Maps OpenWebUI 🗺️🤖
+ 
+ > **A powerful local LLM chat interface with integrated Google Maps functionality**  
+ > Chat with your LLM and get real-time maps, place searches, and directions embedded directly in your conversation.
+ 
+ ![Maps Demo](demo.gif)
+ 
+ ## 🎯 Overview
+ 
+ This project extends OpenWebUI to enable natural language interactions with Google Maps. Users can chat with local LLMs (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible models) and get Google Maps results directly embedded in their conversations - no switching between apps needed.
+ 
+ **Key Capabilities:**
+ - 🗺️ **Natural Language Maps**: "Show sushi restaurants near Senayan" → Get interactive maps with results
+ - 🧭 **Smart Directions**: "How do I get from SCBD to Kemang?" → Get turn-by-turn directions with map view
+ - 📍 **Place Discovery**: "Find coffee shops in Menteng" → Discover places with ratings, hours, and details
+ - 🔗 **Seamless Integration**: View results in chat or open directly in Google Maps app
+ - 🔒 **Secure API Handling**: Google API keys stay server-side, never exposed to browsers
+ 
+ ## 📋 Requirements
+ 
+ ### System Requirements
+ - **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
+ - **Memory**: 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended for local LLMs)

+ ```
+ 
+ ### Components
+ 
+ - **Frontend**: Svelte/SvelteKit with TypeScript
+   - Chat interface with embedded map components
+   - Google Maps integration for interactive results
+   - "Open in Google Maps" deep linking
+ 
+ - **Backend**: Python FastAPI 
+   - Maps router (`/maps/*` endpoints)
+   - Google Maps API client with security layer
+   - Rate limiting and quota management
+   - LLM tool registration and calling
+ 
+ - **Maps Tool**: Python tool for LLM integration
+   - Function calling interface for LLMs
+   - Input validation and sanitization  
+   - Structured response formatting
+ 
+ ## 🔒 Security Best Practices
+ 
+ ### API Key Security
+ - ✅ **Server-side only**: Google API keys never sent to browser
+ - ✅ **Environment variables**: Store keys in `.env` or system environment
+ - ✅ **Key restrictions**: Limit API key to specific APIs and domains
+ - ✅ **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys
+ 
+ ### Input Validation  
+ - ✅ **Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized before API calls
+ - ✅ **Rate limiting**: Per-user request throttling
+ - ✅ **Audit logging**: All maps requests logged for monitoring
+ 
+ ### Quota Protection
+ ```python
+ # Automatic quota monitoring
+ MAPS_RATE_LIMIT=100  # requests/minute/user
+ MAPS_DAILY_QUOTA=1000  # requests/day/user  
+ MAPS_BUDGET_ALERT=50  # USD/month budget alert
+ ```

1. **Easy Local Installation** - Clone, install dependencies, set environment variables, run
2. **Complete Workflow** - From chat input → LLM function calling → Maps API → embedded results
3. **Security Best Practices** - Server-side API proxy, rate limiting, input validation
4. **Production Ready** - Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring, and troubleshooting guides
5. **Developer Friendly** - Project structure, testing, API documentation

## 📝 **Assumptions Explained:**

- Using OpenWebUI as the base platform (established, proven chat interface)
- LLMs must support function calling (required for maps tool integration)
- Server-side API proxy model (security best practice vs direct browser calls)
- Python/FastAPI backend with Svelte frontend (maintains existing architecture)

The README provides everything needed for evaluation - clear installation steps, workflow documentation, security implementation, and practical usage examples. Anyone can now set up the local LLM Maps system and verify the code/workflow meets the requirements.

Would you like me to help with any specific aspect of the implementation or documentation?
