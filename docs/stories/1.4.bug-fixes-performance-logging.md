# Story 1.4: Bug Fixes for Map Tool Performance and Logging

## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** user and system administrator,
**I want** the map tools to respond quickly with proper logging and reliable map visualization including accurate location data,
**so that** I can efficiently use the map functionality without long delays, debug issues when they occur, and consistently see map results with proper latitude/longitude coordinates.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Map tool response times are reduced to under 5 seconds for standard queries
2. Comprehensive logging system captures all API calls to `api/v1/maps/*` with timestamps, request parameters, response times, and error details
3. Map visualization displays correctly when map tools are activated in OpenWebUI chat
4. All Google Maps API responses include validated latitude and longitude data
5. Performance bottlenecks in the Ollama → FastAPI → Google Maps chain are identified and resolved
6. Log analysis tools are available to diagnose map tool issues
7. Error handling prevents map tool failures from blocking chat functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on stories 1.1-1.3, the system architecture includes OpenWebUI frontend, FastAPI backend agent, and Google Maps API integration. Current implementation may have performance and reliability gaps that need addressing.

### System Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architect.md#2-system-overview, docs/architect/2-system-overview.md]

**Frontend:** OpenWebUI (Svelte)
- Displays chat, parses tool call responses for map results
- Renders maps using Google Maps Embed or widget

**Backend:** OpenWebUI Python Service  
- Manages sessions and user input
- Connects to LLM (Ollama/OpenAI) with tool/function-calling enabled
- Registers and invokes tools (find_places, get_directions) via FastAPI

**Map Agent Service:** FastAPI (Python)
- Endpoints: `/find_places`, `/get_directions`, `/place_details`
- Handles all Google Maps API requests, secures API key, applies rate limits and validation
- Sends clean data back to OpenWebUI backend

### API Data Flow and Performance Points
[Source: docs/architect/3-data-api-flow.md]

1. User enters a prompt (e.g., "Show sushi near Senayan")
2. Frontend sends prompt to backend
3. Backend LLM parses intent, triggers `find_places` tool call ⚠️ *Potential bottleneck*
4. Backend → FastAPI agent: makes request ⚠️ *Potential bottleneck*
5. Agent hits Google Maps API, returns structured results ⚠️ *Potential bottleneck*
6. Backend passes results to frontend
7. Frontend renders map/list, adds "Open in Google Maps" links ⚠️ *Visualization issue point*

### API Contract Requirements for Data Validation
[Source: docs/architect/4-agent-api-contracts.md]

**`/find_places` Response Must Include:**
- name, address, **lat/lng**, place_id, rating, open_now, maps_url
- **Critical:** lat/lng coordinates are required and must be validated

**`/get_directions` Response Must Include:**
- steps, distance, duration, maps_url
- **Note:** Should include coordinate data for route visualization

**`/place_details` Response Must Include:**
- details, reviews, photos, maps_url
- **Note:** Should include precise coordinates for place location

### Security and Reliability Requirements
[Source: docs/architect/5-security-reliability.md]

- Google API key only in FastAPI service (never exposed)
- All backend-to-backend traffic, never direct browser calls
- **Input validation, error handling, and rate limiting on FastAPI** ⚠️ *Logging needed here*
- All tool responses sanitized before UI render

### File Locations and Project Structure
Based on existing stories 1.1-1.3, the following file structure should be maintained:

**Backend/API Components:**
- FastAPI agent service files (likely in backend/agent/ or similar)
- OpenWebUI integration files (likely in backend/openwebui/ or similar)
- Logging configuration and middleware files

**Frontend Components:**
- Svelte map display components (likely in frontend/components/ or similar)
- Map rendering and tool response handling

**Configuration:**
- Environment variables for API keys and timeouts
- Logging configuration files
- Performance monitoring setup

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs. Following standard practices:
- Unit tests for API endpoints and data validation
- Integration tests for complete tool calling flow
- Performance tests for response time requirements
- End-to-end tests for map visualization functionality

### Technical Constraints and Considerations
- **Performance Target:** Under 5 seconds response time for standard queries
- **Logging Requirements:** Structured logging with JSON format for analysis
- **Data Quality:** All map responses must include validated lat/lng coordinates
- **Error Resilience:** System must gracefully handle external API failures
- **Security:** Maintain existing API key protection and validation patterns

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Create test files following project testing patterns from existing stories
- Use standard Python testing frameworks (pytest recommended)
- Include both unit tests and integration tests for performance and logging features
- Test map visualization components in Svelte testing environment
- Performance tests should validate sub-5-second response requirements
