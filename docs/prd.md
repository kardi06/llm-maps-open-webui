# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Project: LLM Google Maps Agent for OpenWebUI

---

### 1. Product Vision

Deliver a seamless chat experience in OpenWebUI, allowing users to find places and get directions using natural language. The system should leverage a local LLM (Ollama/Llama3/OpenAI) and Google Maps APIs, while ensuring data security, privacy, and extensibility.

---

### 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

- Users can ask for places (restaurants, ATMs, etc.) and get live map results directly in chat.
- Users can request and view directions in chat or open them in Google Maps.
- All Google Maps API calls are secured through a backend agent (API key never exposed).
- System is extensible for new LLMs, map providers, and future features.
- Google Maps API usage is logged, rate-limited, and monitored to prevent abuse.

---

### 3. User Stories

- **As a user,** I can ask for the best food or attractions near a location and see results on a map in chat.
- **As a user,** I can request directions between two locations and view the route and steps in chat.
- **As a user,** I can click a map or result to open the place or directions in Google Maps.
- **As a business,** I need Google API usage to be secure, rate-limited, and auditable.

---

### 4. Features / Scope

- **Chat UI Enhancements:** Inline display of map widgets and place/direction results.
- **LLM Tool Calling:** Local LLM triggers map/direction queries via backend.
- **FastAPI Proxy Backend:** Secures Google Maps API key, enforces quotas, formats results.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Place search, directions, and embeddable map support.
- **Security & Privacy:** API key is never exposed; backend validation and logging.
- **Extensibility:** Architecture ready for new LLMs, providers, or richer UX.

---

### 5. Out of Scope (for v1)

- No new authentication (beyond what OpenWebUI supports).
- No billing/payments.
- No advanced user profiles or history features.

---

### 6. Milestones & Deliverables

- [ ] FastAPI backend agent with `/find_places`, `/get_directions`, `/place_details`.
- [ ] OpenWebUI backend configured for tool/function registration.
- [ ] Svelte frontend renders maps and results inline.
- [ ] End-to-end test: chat prompt → LLM → backend → Google Maps → chat display.
- [ ] Security, logging, and quota controls in place.

---

### 7. Risks & Dependencies

- LLM must support function/tool calling (model selection matters).
- Google Maps API quotas/costs need monitoring.
- Project needs Python (FastAPI), Svelte, and OpenWebUI integration skills.

---

### 8. Acceptance Criteria

- Place/direction queries return map/results inline in chat.
- Directions are accurate, actionable, and openable in Google Maps.
- No Google API keys are visible to the frontend/user.
- Quota and abuse controls function as intended.
- Codebase allows for extension to new features/providers.
