# Google Maps Agent - Brownfield Enhancement Epic

## Epic Goal

Enable users to interact with Google Maps through natural language chat in OpenWebUI, allowing them to find places and get directions with results displayed inline in the chat interface, while maintaining secure API access through integrated maps functionality in the existing OpenWebUI backend.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current functionality**: OpenWebUI provides a chat interface for LLM interactions with Svelte frontend and Python backend
- **Technology stack**: 
  - Frontend: Svelte/SvelteKit with TypeScript
  - Backend: Python with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, existing router pattern
  - LLM Integration: Supports Ollama/OpenAI with function calling capabilities
- **Integration points**: 
  - Backend routers (`/backend/open_webui/routers/`)
  - Frontend components (`/src/lib/components/`)
  - API structure already established for tools/functions

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added**: Google Maps integration through chat interface allowing users to:
  - Search for places using natural language ("Show sushi near Senayan")
  - Get directions between locations
  - View map results and place details inline in chat
  - Open results in Google Maps application

- **How it integrates**: 
  - New maps router integrated into existing OpenWebUI backend with secure Google Maps API proxy
  - LLM tool/function calling to trigger map queries through existing tool infrastructure
  - Frontend components to render maps and results inline within chat interface
  - Seamless integration with existing OpenWebUI authentication and middleware

- **Success criteria**:
  - Users can successfully find places through chat
  - Directions are accurately displayed with "Open in Google Maps" functionality
  - Google API keys remain secure (never exposed to frontend)
  - Rate limiting and quota controls prevent API abuse

## Stories

**1. Story 1: Backend API Foundation**
Create maps router within existing OpenWebUI backend with core endpoints (`/maps/find_places`, `/maps/get_directions`, `/maps/place_details`) that securely handle Google Maps API requests with rate limiting and validation.

**2. Story 2: LLM Tool Integration** 
Implement LLM tool/function registration and calling capabilities within OpenWebUI backend to trigger map queries from natural language chat prompts, integrating with existing tool infrastructure.

**3. Story 3: Frontend Map Display Components**
Develop Svelte components to render Google Maps results, place information, and directions inline within the chat interface, including "Open in Google Maps" functionality.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (adding new endpoints only)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no schema changes required)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (new chat components follow Svelte component patterns)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (async API calls, cached responses)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Google Maps API quota exhaustion or unexpected costs
- **Mitigation**: Implement strict rate limiting, quota monitoring, and API usage logging in the maps router
- **Rollback Plan**: Disable map tool registration in backend, remove frontend map components - chat functionality returns to original state

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing chat functionality verified through testing (no regression)
- [x] Integration points working correctly (LLM → Backend Maps Router → Frontend)
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately (API endpoints, component usage)
- [x] Security controls verified (API keys secure, rate limiting functional)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No major architectural changes required (extends existing patterns)
- [x] Enhancement follows existing OpenWebUI patterns
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable (REST API integration)

**Risk Assessment:**
- [x] Risk to existing system is low (additive functionality only)
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (disable maps router registration and remove frontend components)
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of FastAPI, Svelte, and API integration

**Completeness Check:**
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [x] Stories are properly scoped and sequenced
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Dependencies identified (Google Maps API, LLM function calling)

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing OpenWebUI system running **Svelte frontend + Python FastAPI backend**
- **Integration points**: 
  - Backend routers pattern (`/backend/open_webui/routers/`)
  - Frontend components pattern (`/src/lib/components/`)
  - Existing LLM tool/function calling infrastructure
- **Existing patterns to follow**: 
  - FastAPI router structure for new endpoints
  - Svelte component architecture for UI elements
  - Async API communication patterns
- **Critical compatibility requirements**: 
  - No changes to existing chat functionality
  - API key security (never exposed to frontend)
  - Rate limiting and quota protection
  - Backward compatibility with existing LLM integrations
- Each story must include verification that existing chat functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering **seamless Google Maps integration through natural language chat**."
